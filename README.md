# Mindustry+ BetaMindy Compatibility
A Json mod for mindustry designed to add features to make mindustry+ and betamindy work well together

It adds wire nodes that are power nodes but have special features so they don't interfere with normal power systems, this is useful to transfer signals from a button to a piston, it requires betamindy as the features it adds are almost useless otherwise
